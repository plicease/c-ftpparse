Snarked ftpparse.[ch] from ftpcopy and just the files that they depend on
to create a libftpparse.  The original ftpcopy can be found here:

http://ohse.de/uwe/ftpcopy/install.html

ftpparse.[ch] is public domain reimplementation of ftpparse.c by Daniel 
J. Bernsteins.  Some of its dependencies are GPLd so the whole library 
is GPL.
